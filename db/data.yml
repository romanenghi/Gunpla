    - MG GOUF Ver.2.0
    - "A Mobile Suit made famous at the hands of ace pilot Lieutenant Ramba Ral, the MS-07B Gouf is a high-performance machine that strikes fear in its opponents with its powerful Heat Saber and Heat Rod at its disposal. This much-anticipated \"Version 2.0\" update to its 2000-released Master Grade kit not only utilizes the same amazingly detailed and super-poseable inner frame from MG MS-06J Zaku II Ver. 2.0, Bandai went a step further in enhancing the inner frame to allow for wider range of posing possibilities and smoother movements! Both the front and side skirt armor parts are linked together so that the side skirt armor will slide back when the front skirt armor is moved upwards so as to not restrict the Mobile Suit's movements. In pursuit of easing the assembly process for modelers, Bandai came up with an ingenious method of molding each individual section of the pipe cover in straight rows on the plastic runner so you can easily insert the power pipe through each row of pipe covers and snap each of them off without having to individually cut and slide each piece to the power pipe! That'll shave off at least a few minutes of assembly time! Its signature weaponry includes a shield, a Heat Saber, a Heat Rod, and a Finger Vulcan for its left hand. A regular manipulator left hand is also included to replace the Finger Vulcan if you so desire. Each section of the Heat Rod is ball-jointed so you can bend it into any shape you want! The blade part of the Heat Saber is made of clear orange, and the Mobile Suit's cockpit can slide open to reveal a sitting-pose pilot figure (molded in light blue). Also packed in the set are in-scale figures (molded in light blue) of Ramba Ral and his aide Crowley Hamon. A sheet of stickers and dry-transfer markings are included. "

Two versions were released from the start -- Char's Zaku and the \"standard-issue,\" green Zaku.Their are several differences in the two kits. Besides the obvious coloring change, Char's Zaku has a spike on the top of its head. In addition, there are numerous changes to the weapons set that comes with each kit. While the basic 120mm machine gun, 280mm bazooka and \"Heat Hawk\" energy axe is standard to both, Char's Zaku includes a 175mm tank gun and two \"Sturmfaust\" units (which look just like giant Panzerfausts). On the other hand, the green Zaku comes with a MMP-80 Machine Gun, two \"Cracker\" space grenades, and missile launchers that strap onto its legs.Like all the kits in the MG series, the level of detail is superb, and virtually everything moves. The pipes running from the thighs to the calves, as well as around the sides of the head are flexible springs covered with plastic tubes. The head has a panel that opens and a small tab on the back of the head lets you position the Zaku's scanner eye.

    - MG 1/100 RX-78 GUNDAM (Ver.1.5)
    - "Back in 1995, Bandai's plastic model division came up with their best idea in years: Start a line of ultra-detailed Gundam kits for adults. The Master Grade series that was born from that idea has, without exaggeration, literally fueled much of the growth of HobbyLink Japan itself!And now, stolen right from the world of computer software, comes another idea that may also prove to be a very good one: Upgrades! \"Version 1.5\" of the RX-78-2 Gundam kit is, with the exception of the arms, an entirely new kit. The proportions of the item have changed to bring it more in line with the Perfect Grade kit of the same mecha. But perhaps most importantly, Bandai has attempted to address one of the biggest troubles that plague posable robot kits -- joints that are too soft -- by creating a one-piece, almost pre-assembled inner leg mechanism that is very firm -- ready to stay put in whatever pose you want it to. Not only that, it doubles as a very cool-looking inner mechanism for when you want to display your kit with the panels open or removed. As usual, you also get a bunch of fun weapons, including the beam rifle, bazooka, a Gundam Hammer with a plastic chain, a new beam javelin, and of course, beam sabers. And like the first release, the Core Fighter is removable."

Even the little attack pods that mount on the back launchers have individually opening panels! Well, if there is one bad thing about this kit, it may be its size. True to the Master Grade series, it is a 1/100 kit, and with this mecha that means it's almost 26cm (over 10 inches!) high when completed.

Have fun putting it all together! Lots of poseability thanks to polycaps at the joints. Just a quick note -- though this is a Master Grade kit, unlike other recent MG kits it does not feature the inner-frame system we've gotten used to (this keeps the kit a little simpler, and keeps the cost down for you!).

    - We wouldn't have thought that Bandai could have improved on their Master Grade kit of the Gundam Mk-II (except, of course, with a PG version!) -- until we saw the Version 2.0! Newly-designed joints allow it incredibly realistic posing -- especially in the legs. A tighter bend at the knee, and a joint that divides the heel and toe of the foot, provides better balance for ""action"" poses, and gives your Mk-II a realistic appearance when it's crouching, as though it's about to spring into action at any time! The kit is all molded in colour and snaps together; vinyl tubing is included for weapons detail. Also included is a catapult display stand -- and three scale figures (one pilot and two maintenance crew) for positioning around the Mk-II while it's "docked." Not just an improvement on the original kit, the Version 2.0 takes the Mk-II to a whole new level!

    - MG TURN A GUNDAM
    - For the distinctive honor of being its 100th Master Grade release, Bandai has selected the every-bit-as-distinctive Turn A Gundam! Featured in Yoshiyuki Tomino's "Turn A Gundam" series, this "mustachioed" Mobile Suit was designed by Syd Mead (whose work can be seen in such movies as "Aliens," "Blade Runner," and "Tron") in a unique departure from the conventional Gundam designs in the franchise. This fantastically detailed kit is packed with abundant features that showcase the hallmarks of the Master Grade series. Every movement that Turn A Gundam can do in the show can be replicated in this kit, thanks to its flexible joints located throughout the body without any armor pieces getting in the way. As seen in the show, the cockpit can be turned into a Core Fighter, thruster vanes on the back of the legs are movable, hatches located on the back can be opened when executing its "Moonlight Butterfly" attack, and hatches located on the chest can be opened to reveal missiles with multipurpose missile silos--and if you're like me and have been aching to recreate the cow-transporting scene from episode 8, just remove those missile silos, insert the included 1/100-scale cow (molded in white), and let the good times roll!Turn A Gundam comes armed with a beam rifle, two beam sabers, a Gundam hammer, and a shield. Both the beam rifle and shield can be mounted on its back. A foil sticker is included along with a sheet of decals for custom markings.

    - "Zeta Gundam was broadcast on Japanese TV during '84/85, following up the original series with a whole new set of characters and machines. Not surprisingly, the robot of the same name was the main piece of hardware in the show. This new show also introduced the \"transformation\" concept to Gundam, and the Zeta does an impressive one, switching from robot mode to \"Wave Rider\" mode in the wink of an eye. Perhaps more impressive is the fact the this Master Grade kit can also make this transformation without a single piece having to be removed or replaced on it (not counting the shield/nose piece, but that's true to the show).This version of the 1/100 MG Zeta Gundam is the test version as it appeared at Anaheim Electronics during the initial phases of the project.Eight full-size runners with hundreds of multi-colored parts make this kit a serious assembly project, but it goes together very smoothly. Besides the transformation capability, the kit includes all kinds of other goodies. As usual, everything moves. Even those antenna on its forehead fold up. Three sets of hands are included -- fists, open palm, and posable. Also includes the usual \"beam saber\" sword, dual Vulcan cannon, beam rifle and shield. All of Bandai's MG (as well as HG) kits are completely snap-together, and parts are molded in color, so no painting is necessary. Of course, the use of cement and paints will improve the appearance of a finished model. Many of the surface markings are printed right onto the plastic parts to begin with, but the kit includes replacement transfers for those people who wish to paint their work. "

    - 1/60 PG RX-78-2 GUNDAM
    - "Things don't get much better than this for Gundam fans.The kit that Bandai has produced is truly amazing. The most striking aspect is the incredible level of INNER detail. It's almost a shame to put any of the cover panels on this thing, because there is so much on the inside that a little silver and black paint will make very interesting to look at. Bandai is aware of this, and is also going to market an optional parts set for the kit that includes transparent body pieces! This is due in December, we're told. That set will also include a light-up beam saber.What can you say about this kit? Though some weapons are not included (no doubt for a later release), it's just about everything you could hope for in terms of detail and poseability. Even little actuators in some joints slide in and out like hydraulic pistons when you move them (wrists, etc.). What's more, a watch battery (CR1220) lights the eyes in the head, activated by a tiny switch on the back. Other gimmicks include wings on the core fighter which fold automatically when you tuck in the nose for docking. For a true Gundam hobbyist, there's simply no question about whether you should order this. Even if you don't plan on painting or gluing anything, you should prepare yourself for several evenings of snipping, trimming and snapping before your masterpiece will be completed. There are, after all, 626 parts on 23 runners which combine to form a model that stands nearly 31cm high and 13cm wide with 66 moving joints and 29 opening hatches. "

This kit has too much to list in detail, so please be willing to settle for the highlights:30-plus runners of parts (670 total pieces). About 30 locations secured by metal screws. Two different locations (eyes and chest) light up on the finished kit. Full inner mechanism detail on all limbs. Opening panels on the head, chest, and more. Fingers are individually jointed. Comes with two beam sabers and two huge beam rifles. Locking systems provide stability so things don't flap around like they tend to do on the Master Grade kit. Comes boxed in three separate inner boxes plus a special box that contains the 14 individual \"feathers\" made from plastic-coated thin metal, plus the metal joint parts, screws, and other goodies. Two separate manuals are included. The first, the INSTRUCTION manual (text is in Japanese), has numerous photos of the kit in various construction steps plus painting guide, history of the unit and the Battle Zero unit, cross sections, and an interview with the designer of the kit. The second, the CONSTRUCTION manual, has the actual assembly instructions and details. No English text but the diagrams are self-explanatory.This is a very complex model kit and is not recommended for beginner modelers. "

    - "Okay, for a monster machine like this, with parts sticking out all over, and which is so top heavy it cannot stand on its own, the naming of \"Ex-S\" seems appropriate, considering the homonym \"excess.\"But gosh, it's sooo sharp looking... Let me come back to that point about standing up by itself: It can't. At first, when I saw that this kit came with a display stand to hold it up, I was greatly dissapointed, as I really was looking forward to building it. But then I started thinking about all the other Gundam kits of mine that have fallen over and broken or lost parts when I had them posed someplace, and I began to think that maybe a display stand isn't such a bad idea after all...Of course the kit can transform into the long-range \"G-Cruiser\" mode, similar to the Zeta Gundam, and the display stand itself also converts into a mode specifically designed for displaying the kit when it's in ship mode. A whopping 31 runners of parts in all! Get ready for hours of cuttin' 'n' snappin' with this baby!"

    - We wouldn't have thought that Bandai could have improved on their Master Grade kit of the Gundam Mk-II (except, of course, with a PG version!) -- until we saw the Version 2.0 -- and here it is now in the long-awaited Titans colour scheme! Newly-designed joints allow it incredibly realistic posing -- especially in the legs. A tighter bend at the knee, and a joint that divides the heel and toe of the foot, provides better balance for ""action"" poses, and gives your Mk-II a realistic appearance when it's crouching, as though it's about to spring into action at any time! The kit is all molded in colour and snaps together; vinyl tubing is included for weapons detail. Also included are three scale figures (one pilot and two maintenance crew) for positioning around the Mk-II while it's "docked". Not just an improvement on the original kit, the Version 2.0 takes the Mk.II to a whole new level!

Panels and hatches all over the surface open, to reveal inner mechanical details. What's more, after you get done wading through over two dozen runners of literally thousands of parts, you'll have armament for the GP01 including two 60mm Vulcans, two beam sabers, and a beam rifle, as well as the Core Fighter II. For the GP01Fb, there are two extra beam guns, and you can build the Core Fighter II Fb. But that's not all -- the kit also includes the parts to build a hangar/dock (see photos below), with little figures of maintenance workers to position around it! A bonus card with a serial number on it also included. Act now, and add this beauty to your Perfect Grade collection (and don't forget to budget for the shipping costs, this item weighs 5kg/11 lbs.)!

    - 1/48 RX-78-2 GUNDAM
    - It's here...and it's huge! The announcement of a 1/48 scale Gundam sent ripples through the modeling community and now, verily, it has come to pass. Of course, the size alone of this kit is impressive. Once assembled it will stand 37.5cm (almost 15 inches) tall, but perhaps the most impressive aspect of this monstrous kit is that you don't need any tools! That's right! The pieces attach to the runner by a very thin length of plastic so you can break the pieces off with your hands! If some parts prove difficult for you, Bandai has even included a 'Double Separator' tool! To make things even easier, Bandai has made it so that you can snap two runners together and then remove the individual pieces. This must be the 'double' in the 'Double Separator". What a time saver! There are even icons on the runners to indicate which part of the kit the pieces are for. Of course, the 1/48 Gundam comes with two 1/48 beam sabers and his large (even larger now) beam rifle, and shield. There is even a mini-booklet from Dengeki Hobby with detailed modeling tips for this beast! Don't be intimidated by its size, this kit is a snap. (The 1/144 Gundam shown with the 1/48 one below is just for size comparison; a 1/144 Gundam is not included.)

    - HG GN-X
    - Utilized by the UN Forces, this mecha was designed after a leak of data from Celestial Being allowing the manufacture of solar furnaces. These mecha are usually used en masse and contain the same GN drive as a Gundam Throne, and thus can stand up to a Gundam. A relatively simple kit, this HG GN-X is good for beginning modelers. The instructions are simple and easy to understand, and the pieces are molded in color and snap together, so you can complete the model without glue or paint. Stickers are included for the purple sections. For best durability and appearance, gluing and painting are possible. Multiple armaments are included to be modeled, including a beam rifle, as well as a longer barrel attachment, shield, and two swords. Interchangeable hands allow for swapping of weapons after completion.

    - HG GN ARMS TYPE D + GUNDAM DYNAMES
    - Gundam Dynames makes a dynamic return to Bandai's HG Gundam 00 lineup, this time packed with its transformable GN Arms! This big box set includes sharply detailed snap-fit plastic kits of GN Arms Type-D and Gundam Dynames, all molded in color. As in the show, GN Arms Type-D can switch to GN Armor mode to allow Gundam Dynames to dock with it for a major boost in both speed and firepower. The weapons included with GN Armor mode are two large GN Cannons, a large openable missile container, and a foldable GN Twin Rifle. This Gundam Dynames kit is almost the same as the previously released HG Gundam Dynames, with the exception of a pair of GN Beam Pistols and holsters added for this release. A display base and a sheet of foil stickers are provided. An in-scale Lockon Stratos pilot figure wielding his aim assist device is also included (the figure is molded in white and comes on a display base), which allows you to recreate the memorable scene from episode 23 of the show where you-know-who did you-know-what...

All parts are molded in colored plastic and snap together easily. Excellent engineering of the arms and legs as well as several polycaps allow flexibility to match the 'real' thing. Included is the hydrojet booster pack, to allow the Z'gock-E to float in 'cruising mode' underwater. Stickers are included for detail. While no paint is required, if you wish to paint the model, a more 'realistic' effect can be achieved.

Aside from the improved articulation, one of the major features of this kit is the incredible new molding process that has two different sections of the pipes molded together for easy slide assembly. Weapons include a Zaku machine gun, Zaku bazooka, heat hawk, and a pair of three-tube missile pods. Two types of blade antennas are thoughtfully included if you plan on building a Zaku II commander mass production type MS, plus two 1/100-scale pilot figures are also provided to man the MS. An incredible kit that's not to be missed!

(The package notes that there may be cases of a kit not able to fit.)Each Action Base 1 can be attached to up to six other Action Base 1s for you to create an amazing display filled with Gundam kits or other robot kits striking cool action poses! Check out the other color variations, linked below!

    - "4543112609960"
    - http://static.hlj.com/images/ban/ban960996box.jpg
    - Here's a superb set that not only pairs up the previously-released HG 00 Gundam with HG 0 Raiser, it also includes its most powerful weapon GN sword III with a clear pink beam effect part! Both kits come molded in color and 00 Gundam will be fully articulated with polycapped joints upon completion. Like its anime counterpart, 0 Raiser can dock with 00 Gundam to form 00 Raiser. Weapons include two GN sword IIs and one GN sword III that can switch to GN rifle II and GN rifle IIIs respectively, two GN beam sabers, and a shield. Foil stickers are included for detail. A black stand is also provided to assist with displaying the completed model in dynamic mid-air poses. The Action Base 2 Sparkle Clear Green shown in the photos below is not included, sold separately.

    - Yes, the Gouf has already been redone in 1/144 with the Gouf Custom from "08th MS Team," but this version is much more true to the original appearance of the machine from the 1979 Gundam television series.Kit details are what you would expect in any modern Bandai mecha kit release (full posability, color molding, snap assembly, etc.). This kit also comes with the "heat rod" whip-like weapon, a shield that can store the heat saber, backpack, Zaku machine gun, and a 75mm finger cannon. Stickers are included for parts not molded in color.

Its incredibly well-engineered inner frame is capable of striking dynamic and realistic poses. The transformable Core Fighter can be docked inside Gundam to become its cockpit. Gundam's movements are not restricted even when the Core Fighter is docked inside its torso, thanks to its ingeniously designed and intricately detailed inner frame!The Mobile Suit's armaments include a beam rifle with removable super napalm attachment, two beam sabers, shield, hyper bazooka, Gundam Hammer, and beam javelin. Three unpainted (molded in white) 1/100 figures of Amuro Ray--two standing (casual wear and pilot suit) and one sitting--are also provided. Then we have the air support unit G-Fighter that boasts impressive realistic mechanical detail, right down to the insides of its container compartment and main generator! G-Fighter consists of two main separable components: G-Part A and G-Part B. Both parts are made to combine with the Gundam Real Type Color Ver.2.0 kit to form its six G-Modules: G-Bull, G-Bull Easy, G-Armor, G-Fighter, G-Sky, G-Sky Easy, and Gundam High Mobility Type (Gundam Sky). The G-Fighter can also be used as a Sub Flight System whereby the Gundam stands atop the spacecraft with stoppers holding its feet in place. Accessories include a shield, Hyper Hammer, landing gears, and a support arm attachment that connects to Action Base 1 Gray (shown below, sold separately) for mid-flight displays. Also provided are same-scale figures (molded in white) of Sayla Mass and Sleggar Law (both characters in standing and sitting poses), plus two crew members. Marking stickers and dry transfer decals are also included for adding custom detail to your completed models."

It's fully-transformable when completed, too. What more could you ask for? (well, a life-sized version would be nice, but you'd get tired just lifting the polycaps, trust me). Shield and beam mega launcher weapons (as well as the regular rifle, beam sabres, etc.) are included, and a custom catapult stand is included to hold it all up -- with all the extra armour and weaponry, it'll be a little heavy when completed! Two unpainted pilots and an unpainted miscellaneous crew member are included. All parts snap together and are molded in colour so paint and glue for the kit are not necessary; foil stickers and clear Gundam stickers are included for detail. However, if you'd like to paint it, it would look pretty spiffalicious, and a paint scheme is provided (paint is of course sold separately).

Well armed with two beam sabers and 12 1.3MW funnel remote beam weapons plus impressive speed and maneuverability it is a fantastic answer to the newer Gundams arrayed against it.Bandai has struck MG gold yet again with this kit. In typical MG fashion EVERYTHING moves. From the head to the individual finger joints to the 10 funnel systems, each can be individually posed and removed. The shoulder armor opens just like the prototype. Opening cockpit area. Of course all parts are pre-colored and assembly is literally a snap. However the appearance of the finished kit will be immeasurably improved by painting.The 19 page instruction manual covers the design history of the AX-004 with line drawings.

About 270 plastic parts (all molded in colour) snap together for assembly; polycaps at the joints ensure superb flexibility. Building starts with Bandai's world-famous "inner frame" system, designed to allow the final product to move and pose as it would in the original series; then the armour, including the wings for which the mecha was named, is attached to the frame. Included weapons are the built-in machine cannons (in the shoulders), two Beam Sabres, and the Twin Buster Rifles. A custom display stand (unassembled and unpainted) is included so you can pose the finished mecha in any number of mid-flight poses, while keeping it safe.

Foil stickers, clear stickers, and Bandai's very sharp dry-transfer decals, are included for adding detail to the model once built.

    - "Bandai treats fans to another great MG \"Ver. 2.0\" update of the Zaku II, this time the custom space-type Zaku II of the Black Trinity! Based on the version in the \"M.S.V.\" (Mobile Suit Variations) series, this highly anticipated update of 1999's MG MS-06R Zaku II Black Trinity has sharp new features made possible by today's advanced injection molding technology: individually articulated fingers (no more swapping around with other fixed-pose optional hands!); cockpit hatch that slides up to reveal the detailed cockpit; pilot seat that can switch sides from left to right by turning a lever; and best of all, its inner mechanical frame and overall body design uses the same molds as the MG Zaku II Ver. 2.0 that boasts wildly articulated joints to set it in just about any action pose you can think of! This is not only a great improvement over the 1999 MG kit, but is also more accurately detailed to its M.S.V. design!This space-type Mobile Suit is a distinctively customized Zaku II with the Black Trinity's color scheme, additional thrusters on its legs, and a jet pack attachment on its back for increased mobility. Sharply molded in color, this snap-fit assembly kit does not require any cement or paint to complete (of course, the use of paint will improve the appearance of a finished model). Stickers and dry transfers for markings. Weapons and accessories include a heat hawk, Zaku machine gun, giant bazooka rocket version, Zaku bazooka, and two types of blade antennas (normal type and stabilizer type). Six 1/100-scale unpainted Black Trinity pilot figures--two apiece of Gaia, Ortega, and Mash (one standing and one sitting)--complete this highly recommended kit! (Get three to complete the Black Trinity team and display them performing their signature Jet Stream attack!)"

    - There's no better justice than Infinite Justice--and Bandai does justice to the Mobile Suit with this highly anticipated Master Grade release! This sharply detailed snap-fit kit of Athrun Zala's personal Mobile Suit comes molded in color, and upon completion the mech will be fully poseable with polycapped joints that allow for posing possibilities galore. This kit introduces to the MG series a new joint system for its side skirt armor that allows you to pose Infinite Justice Gundam kicking, as seen in "Gundam Seed Destiny"!Included are a beam rifle that can be mounted on its back skirt armor, two "Super Lacerta" Beam Sabers that can combine to form a double-bladed beam weapon, and a left arm-mounted shield that stores a detachable "Shining Edge" Beam Boomerang and Grapple Stinger (a bendable wire is provided to display it in mid-deployment). Beam effect parts for the Beam Sabers, "Griffon" Beam Blades connecting the knees and feet, Beam Boomerang, and shield are provided as well.Accompanying Infinite Justice Gundam is the Phantom-01 backpack that can be attached to the mech's back for a boost in speed and firepower. The engine covers can slide out to reveal detailed vernier nozzles. Two same-scale unpainted figures (molded in white) of Athrun in standing and sitting poses are included, along with dry-transfer decals, stickers, and foil stickers for detail. (Bandai's Action Base shown in the photos below is sold separately.)

    - Piloted by Shin "The White Wolf" Matsunaga, the custom white Zaku II Mobile Suit from the "M.S.V." (Mobile Suit Variations) series was introduced as an MG kit back in 1996. Now the kit has been upgraded to today's Master Grade modeling standards with sharply detailed snap-fit parts that come molded in color, and it also has the hyper-articulated joints that debuted in the 1/100 MG MS-06J Zaku II Ver.2.0 kit. This high-mobility Mobile Suit comes equipped with a super-detailed backpack attachment, a Heat Hawk, Zaku machine gun, and parts to make either the Zaku bazooka or a prototype Zaku bazooka. Two types of blade antennas (normal type and stabilizer type) are provided, along with marking stickers, dry-transfer AND water-transfer decals to add custom detail to your completed kit.

    - "4543112587565"
    - http://static.hlj.com/images/ban/ban958756box.jpg
    - A Mobile Suit made famous at the hands of ace pilot Lieutenant Ramba Ral, the MS-07B Gouf is a high-performance machine that strikes fear in its opponents with its powerful Heat Saber and Heat Rod at its disposal. This much-anticipated "Version 2.0" update to its 2000-released Master Grade kit not only utilizes the same amazingly detailed and super-poseable inner frame from MG MS-06J Zaku II Ver. 2.0, Bandai went a step further in enhancing the inner frame to allow for wider range of posing possibilities and smoother movements! Both the front and side skirt armor parts are linked together so that the side skirt armor will slide back when the front skirt armor is moved upwards so as to not restrict the Mobile Suit's movements. In pursuit of easing the assembly process for modelers, Bandai came up with an ingenious method of molding each individual section of the pipe cover in straight rows on the plastic runner so you can easily insert the power pipe through each row of pipe covers and snap each of them off without having to individually cut and slide each piece to the power pipe! That'll shave off at least a few minutes of assembly time! Its signature weaponry includes a shield, a Heat Saber, a Heat Rod, and a Finger Vulcan for its left hand. A regular manipulator left hand is also included to replace the Finger Vulcan if you so desire. Each section of the Heat Rod is ball-jointed so you can bend it into any shape you want! The blade part of the Heat Saber is made of clear orange, and the Mobile Suit's cockpit can slide open to reveal a sitting-pose pilot figure (molded in light blue). Also packed in the set are in-scale figures (molded in light blue) of Ramba Ral and his aide Crowley Hamon. A sheet of stickers and dry-transfer markings are included.

    - Perfect for displaying small-scale Gundam model kits, Action Base 2 is designed to hold kits from Bandai's HGUC, FG, HG Gundam 00, HG Gundam Seed, 1/144-scale models, and SD Gundam series. No other display bases from other companies come close to what this amazing display base allows you to do!Action Base 2 is a plastic injection snap-fit assembly kit that requires very little work to assemble. No cement or paint required! The trapezium bases (two included) come with cool mechanical detailing and panel lines, with one hole per base for placing the stand. The stand can be extended upwards for posing your kit in a much higher position, and the angle of the stand can also be adjusted to lift or lower your kit. The stand can also be used on Action Base 1 to pose two kits on a single base in close combat!The set comes with two different sizes (6mm and 7mm) of U-shaped holders, two peg-type holders, and one screw-on type holder (four screws and three nuts are included) for attaching the main stand to the crotch of your kit. When using the U-shaped or screw-on holders, double-sided tape should be applied in between the crotch of the kit and the holders to help hold it in place. (The package notes that there may be cases of a kit not able to fit.)Each Action Base 2 (two trapezium bases combined) can be attached to up to six other Action Base 2s for you to create an amazing display filled with Gundam kits or other robot kits striking cool action poses!

    - Simple kit of the Launcher Strike Gundam featured in Gundam Seed. This low-priced kit lacks complete articulation like the more expensive HGUC and Master Grade kits, but it is still rather nicely detailed, and very easy to assemble. Has basic articulation at the hips and shoulders, and some slight movement at the ankles, keeping polycaps and pieces to a minimum. A great model for someone just starting out, or if you're looking for something to detail on your own as a static display piece.

The price is the same as the original, too, at just 300 yen. Note, however, that although this is a snap-assembly kit, it is NOT molded in color (all white plastic) and does not contain poly-caps (though it is reasonably posable). The tooling, however, is as sharp and detailed as we have come to expect from Bandai recently. What more do you want for 300 yen?

No cement or paint required! The trapezium bases (two included) come with cool mechanical detailing and panel lines, with one hole per base for placing the stand. The stand can be extended upwards to pose your kit in a higher position, and the angle of the stand can also be adjusted to lift or lower your kit. The stand can also be used on Action Base 1 to pose two kits on a single base in close combat!The set comes with two different sizes (6mm and 7mm) of U-shaped holders, two peg-type holders, and one screw-on type holder (four screws and three nuts are included) to attach the main stand to the crotch of your kit. When using the U-shaped or screw-on holders, double-sided tape should be applied in between the crotch of the kit and the holders to help hold it in place. (The package notes that there may be cases of a kit not able to fit.)Each Action Base 2 (two trapezium bases combined) can be attached to up to six other Action Base 2s for you to create an amazing display filled with Gundam kits or other robot kits striking cool action poses!

Very nicely-done with \"mekki\"-plating on the major parts (which of course can be removed if you prefer to paint your kits, by careful application of ordinary household bleach); all the parts snap together and don't require paint. Nifty clear effect parts for the Akatsuki's various weapons are included, which is a nice bonus. Gundam decals for markings, and foil stickers for the eyes, are also included. "

    - Over a decade since the first MG Zaku II kit release and several MG Zaku II variations later, this Zeon MS finally gets the "Ver. 2.0" treatment with a completely revamped inner frame construction that allows for even greater range of articulation and realistic movements--you can even pose it kneeling on one leg as seen in the show! Aside from the improved articulation, one of the major features of this kit is the incredible new molding process that has two different sections of the pipes molded together for easy slide assembly. Weapons include a Zaku machine gun, Zaku bazooka, heat hawk, and a pair of three-tube missile pods. Two types of blade antennas are thoughtfully included if you plan on building a Zaku II commander mass production type MS, plus two 1/100-scale pilot figures are also provided to man the MS. An incredible kit that's not to be missed!

Requires an extra bit of work, with some screws to be put into place and a tiny bit of gluing for the three little bits of extra armor on the helmet, which are optional.

But with this being Bandai's High Grade "Universal Century" series, that plastic does this double-handful of 'bot fine justice indeed! Typical Bandai High Grade kit quality with beautiful detail, snap assembly, and full poseability with poly-caps. Weapons load includes a beam rifle, as well as a beam sword for The-O's hideaway extra arms to wield! Comes with stickers for the details that are not molded in color.

The box is huge; though the scale is 1/144 the box is easily as big as that of a Master Grade kit! But all those parts (about 218, plus polycaps), are necessary -- the completed model folds down into Mobile Armour! Molded all in colour; features snap-fit assembly, and stickers for details.

    - Bandai's Master Grade (MG) "RX-78-2" is meant to attract the mature modeler who remembers growing up with Gundam, but wouldn't think of building the primitive kits that were released when Gundam first was broadcast in 1980 (the original kit is still available, by the way. 700 yen).Like all the kits in the MG series, the level of detail is superb, and virtually everything moves. Panels on the legs flip open to reveal internal mechanisms. The head has a panel, too. Even the "Core Fighter" cockpit ship can be removed from its belly. Fine mesh parts cover the inside of the chest air intakes for added realism. Three types of hands are included -- open palm, fists, and posable (moving fingers) for gripping any of the several weapons that comes with the kit.All of Bandai's MG (as well as HG) kits are completely snap-together, and parts are molded in color, so no painting is necessary. Of course, the use of cement and paints will improve the appearance of a finished model. Many of the surface markings are printed right onto the plastic parts to begin with, but the kit includes replacement transfers for those people who wish to paint their work.The RX-78-3 kit is identical to the RX-78-2 except that it is molded in blue and gray plastic, rather than the more "festive" colors of the original.

    - From the start of the Gundam TV series, the Zaku (bad guy) kits outsold the Gundam (good guy) kits by over a 2:1 margin. Let's face it -- the Zaku is cooler looking. Bandai put the Zaku kits on sale a couple of months after the RX-78-2 kit and their sales, too, have surpassed that of the Gundam. Two versions were released from the start -- Char's Zaku and the "standard-issue," green Zaku.Their are several differences in the two kits. Besides the obvious coloring change, Char's Zaku has a spike on the top of its head. In addition, there are numerous changes to the weapons set that comes with each kit. While the basic 120mm machine gun, 280mm bazooka and "Heat Hawk" energy axe is standard to both, Char's Zaku includes a 175mm tank gun and two "Sturmfaust" units (which look just like giant Panzerfausts). On the other hand, the green Zaku comes with a MMP-80 Machine Gun, two "Cracker" space grenades, and missile launchers that strap onto its legs.Like all the kits in the MG series, the level of detail is superb, and virtually everything moves. The pipes running from the thighs to the calves, as well as around the sides of the head are flexible springs covered with plastic tubes. The head has a panel that opens and a small tab on the back of the head lets you position the Zaku's scanner eye. Three types of hands are included -- open palm, fists, and posable (moving fingers).All of Bandai's MG (as well as HG) kits are completely snap-together, and parts are molded in color, so no painting is necessary. Of course, the use of cement and paints will improve the appearance of a finished model. Many of the surface markings are printed right onto the plastic parts to begin with, but the kit includes replacement transfers for those people who wish to paint their work.

    - The MG GP01 fully lives up to the billing of Bandai's superb series of "Master Grade" kits. Ten runners of parts plus poly-caps combine to form a fully-posable and exquisitely-detailed model of the main mecha from Gundam 0083 in its early form (Bandai has also produced a "Full Burner" version, linked below).Besides the standard beam saber, shield and rifle accessories, the "Core Fighter" pulls out of the middle of the model and transforms into a jet fighter-type vehicle. Like other MG kits, inner mechanical details and opening hatches are to be found throughout the model.Molded in color and featuring snap-together assembly, this model looks great just stuck together right out of the box. Of course, for a truly professional appearance, you'll also want to use glue and paint. Foil sticker, dry transfer and clear sticker markings are included.

    - This great little amphibious mech was part of the Zeon fleet as seen in Gundam 0080, "War in the Pocket". Bandai's faithful reproduction in High Grade style is beautifully-detailed, of course. All parts are molded in colored plastic and snap together easily. Excellent engineering of the arms and legs as well as several polycaps allow flexibility to match the 'real' thing. Included is the hydrojet booster pack, to allow the Z'gock-E to float in 'cruising mode' underwater. Stickers are included for detail. While no paint is required, if you wish to paint the model, a more 'realistic' effect can be achieved.

    - Here it is, easily the largest and most-involved kit to be released yet in the Bandai Master Grade series. And frankly, after looking at the contents, 4000 yen seems cheap.There are 16 runners of parts here. 16! Even if you don't paint or glue this kit (naturally it's all snap-assembly), it's going to take a few hours to put it together properly.As usual, everything on the kit moves. Those shoulder "binders" are particularly interesting, especially the way the outer nozzle pivots downward. The "atomic bazooka" can be mounted in the hand in firing position, or it breaks down into two pieces, the barrel mounting in the inside of the shield (see photo), with the remainder mounting on the GP02's back.Comes with the usual stickers, inner-mechanism detail, multiple sets of hands, beam saber, and stuff I've probably overlooked.

Little else needs to be said here, as most of you are no doubt all too familiar with the characteristics of these kits by now: fully posable, molded in color, snap assembly, etc., etc. Includes the usual array of Zaku weapons -- the \"Heat Hawk\" axe, Zaku Machine Gun, and bazooka.

That means nearly every part of the kit poses after completion (including cool forearm gattling guns that pop up!), that there are loads of inner detail parts, that the kit is molded in color and that it features snap-assembly with poly-caps for smooth joint action. But this kit has a twist you don't usually see: It also features a set of removable battle armor! Besides the armor, you also get the usual shield, rifle and beam saber as well.

    - Here's the latest eye-popping Bandai engineering masterpiece, the very busy ZZ Gundam from the series of the same name. And you know it wouldn't be a proper Master Grade kit unless it could do all the transformations seen in the show, as well.There are well over 500 parts here that go together to create a robot that can switch between the massive G-Fortress flyer, the core base, core top and core fighter individual units, plus of course the actual ZZ Gundam itself. Sure, there's a lot of adjusting necessary to make everything work, but that's the fun part of these now isn't it?The kit is a mostly standard Master Grade release, and for those of you who have never built one, that means it's incredible!Inner detail is not as good as some other MG releases, but given the nature of the ZZ, that's not surprising. Fully posable hands are just part of the completely posable structure that lets you duplicate virtually any scene you can think of. Comes with two beam sabers, and a huge double cannon.

    - "Back in 1995, Bandai's plastic model division came up with their best idea in years: Start a line of ultra-detailed Gundam kits for adults. The Master Grade series that was born from that idea has, without exaggeration, literally fueled much of the growth of HobbyLink Japan itself!And now, stolen right from the world of computer software, comes another idea that may also prove to be a very good one: Upgrades! \"Version 1.5\" of the RX-78-2 Gundam kit is, with the exception of the arms, an entirely new kit. The proportions of the item have changed to bring it more in line with the Perfect Grade kit of the same mecha. But perhaps most importantly, Bandai has attempted to address one of the biggest troubles that plague posable robot kits -- joints that are too soft -- by creating a one-piece, almost pre-assembled inner leg mechanism that is very firm -- ready to stay put in whatever pose you want it to. Not only that, it doubles as a very cool-looking inner mechanism for when you want to display your kit with the panels open or removed. As usual, you also get a bunch of fun weapons, including the beam rifle, bazooka, a Gundam Hammer with a plastic chain, a new beam javelin, and of course, beam sabers. And like the first release, the Core Fighter is removable. What's stopping you...order your upgrade today!"

    - At every hobby industry show in Japan for the last three years, I have been begging the Bandai people to do a Master Grade Sazabi, which is probably my favorite mecha of all time from the Gundam universe. I still cannot believe it has finally happened!There is nothing to complain about here at all. The kit looks great and includes everything you would expect it to. Even the little attack pods that mount on the back launchers have individually opening panels! Well, if there is one bad thing about this kit, it may be its size. True to the Master Grade series, it is a 1/100 kit, and with this mecha that means it's almost 26cm (over 10 inches!) high when completed. The box is the same size as the Perfect Grade Gundam, and weighs 1.3kg. That means that shipping of this to Canadian and European addresses is about 5000 yen by SAL Parcel (because we cannot ship it by small packet; via EMS is 4700 yen). But trust me, it's worth it for an item this impressive on your Gundam shelf!

The fin funnel system is posable. Weapons include Beam Rifle, Shield, New Hyper Bazooka, Fin Funnel, Custom Beam Saber and Beam Saber (how can this thing move?). Instruction book is 23 pages long with details of prototype (in Japanese) and full painting guide. Stickers and dry transfers for markings. This is one big, bad-looking Gundam!

This all new design is made from ABS plastic and screws together. No polycaps! The resulting frame is extremely strong and holds positions without the sagging that earlier poly-cap designs suffered from. Plus it is amazingly poseable - the box art shows the mech standing with its arms crossed. We built one here to try it and it is incredible. I actually had it balanced on one leg while doing a sweep kick pose.The rest of the kit is typical Master-Grade quality. All parts are precolored and snap together. Dry transfers for markings. Includes a figure of the pilot - Domon Kasshu. Two sets of hands - one standard and one in clear yellow to replicate the look of the energy ball attack.

    - From the Gundam 'gaiden' ('side stories'), Bandai brings us the stunning RX-78-4 Gundam G04 in nothing less than a Master Grade kit. Made up of 11 runners of injection plastic and one runner of polycaps, with two small sets of decals for detail, this is easily one of the most complex of the Gundam versions. Have fun putting it all together! Lots of poseability thanks to polycaps at the joints. Just a quick note -- though this is a Master Grade kit, unlike other recent MG kits it does not feature the inner-frame system we've gotten used to (this keeps the kit a little simpler, and keeps the cost down for you!).

A one-touch spring switch will release the claws on the right "hand", causing them to pop out quite menacingly! Two sets of "effect parts" are included, too -- one features missiles coming out of the Acguy's left "hand", and the other portrays the aquatic jet-streams from the thrusters under the Acguy's feet.A custom stand is included so you can display the Acguy swimming; and a total of six figures are included -- one seated pilot, that can be placed into the cockpit, one standing pilot, and one guy in scuba gear who can be displayed swimming along with the Acguy; plus the three annoying adorable little kids, Katsu, Retsu, and Kikka.The Acguy's parts are all molded in colored plastic and snap together for assembly; no paint is required (though painting would definitely improve the overall appearance of the finished model). All the figures, however, will require paint. Stickers and dry transfers are included for a perfect finish.

    - We wouldn't have thought that Bandai could have improved on their Master Grade kit of the Gundam Mk-II (except, of course, with a PG version!) -- until we saw the Version 2.0! Newly-designed joints allow it incredibly realistic posing -- especially in the legs. A tighter bend at the knee, and a joint that divides the heel and toe of the foot, provides better balance for ""action"" poses, and gives your Mk-II a realistic appearance when it's crouching, as though it's about to spring into action at any time! The kit is all molded in colour and snaps together; vinyl tubing is included for weapons detail. Also included is a catapult display stand -- and three scale figures (one pilot and two maintenance crew) for positioning around the Mk-II while it's "docked." Not just an improvement on the original kit, the Version 2.0 takes the Mk-II to a whole new level! It's only available in A.E.U.G. colours for now (but will probably come out in Titans colours soon!).

Now, more than a decade later, Bandai astounds us again with this "Ver. 2.0." update of Char's custom commander type Gelgoog! Its inner frame construction has been completely revamped for even greater range of articulation and realistic movements! Its sharply detailed armor parts are removable for a cross-section display to show the magnificently detailed mechanisms. Weapons include the Beam Naginata with optional parts to convert into a sword type, a beam rifle, and a shield with a mount arm to connect it to the Mobile Suit's back with articulated joints for quick deployment. Two types of blade antennas (normal and stabilizer type) are included, along with decals for custom markings and an in-scale Ele-car with Lalah Sune and Char Aznable (sitting and standing). Don't miss out on this superb kit!

This big box set includes sharply detailed snap-fit plastic kits of GN Arms Type-D and Gundam Dynames, all molded in color.

The weapons included with GN Armor mode are two large GN Cannons, a large openable missile container, and a foldable GN Twin Rifle.

A display base and a sheet of foil stickers are provided.

    - For the distinctive honor of being its 100th Master Grade release, Bandai has selected the every-bit-as-distinctive Turn A Gundam! Featured in Yoshiyuki Tomino's "Turn A Gundam" series, this "mustachioed" Mobile Suit was designed by Syd Mead (whose work can be seen in such movies as "Aliens," "Blade Runner," and "Tron") in a unique departure from the conventional Gundam designs in the franchise. This fantastically detailed kit is packed with abundant features that showcase the hallmarks of the Master Grade series. Every movement that Turn A Gundam can do in the show can be replicated in this kit, thanks to its flexible joints located throughout the body without any armor pieces getting in the way. As seen in the show, the cockpit can be turned into a Core Fighter, thruster vanes on the back of the legs are movable, hatches located on the back can be opened when executing its "Moonlight Butterfly" attack, and hatches located on the chest can be opened to reveal missiles with multipurpose missile silos--and if you're like me and have been aching to recreate the cow-transporting scene from episode 8, just remove those missile silos, insert the included 1/100-scale cow (molded in white), and let the good times roll!Turn A Gundam comes armed with a beam rifle, two beam sabers, a Gundam hammer, and a shield. Both the beam rifle and shield can be mounted on its back. A foil sticker is included along with a sheet of decals for custom markings.The item shown is a pre-production sample. The actual item may differ.

    - Utilized by the UN Forces, this mecha was designed after a leak of data from Celestial Being allowing the manufacture of solar furnaces. These mecha are usually used en masse and contain the same GN drive as a Gundam Throne, and thus can stand up to a Gundam. A relatively simple kit, this HG GN-X is good for beginning modelers. The instructions are simple and easy to understand, and the pieces are molded in color and snap together, so you can complete the model without glue or paint. Stickers are included for the purple sections. For best durability and appearance, gluing and painting are possible. Multiple armaments are included to be modeled, including a beam rifle, as well as a longer barrel attachment, shield, and two swords. Interchangeable hands allow for swapping of weapons after completion.

    - It's here...and it's huge! The announcement of a 1/48 scale Gundam sent ripples through the modeling community and now, verily, it has come to pass. Of course, the size alone of this kit is impressive. Once assembled it will stand 37.5cm (almost 15 inches) tall, but perhaps the most impressive aspect of this monstrous kit is that you don't need any tools! That's right! The pieces attach to the runner by a very thin length of plastic so you can break the pieces off with your hands! If some parts prove difficult for you, Bandai has even included a 'Double Separator' tool! To make things even easier, Bandai has made it so that you can snap two runners together and then remove the individual pieces. This must be the 'double' in the 'Double Separator". What a time saver! There are even icons on the runners to indicate which part of the kit the pieces are for. Of course, the 1/48 Gundam comes with two 1/48 beam sabers and his large (even larger now) beam rifle, and shield. There is even a mini-booklet from Dengeki Hobby with detailed modeling tips for this beast! Don't be intimidated by its size, this kit is a snap. (The 1/144 Gundam shown with the 1/48 one below is just for size comparison; a 1/144 Gundam is not included.)

It features superior flexibility -- Bandai's designed an all-new, unique inner frame system for this model, to match the proportions of the mecha designs in the series. The waist joints even allow it to bend side to side, and twist realistically! The \"camera eyes\" light up with internal wiring and a single LED. Not surprisingly, a lot of parts are required to create the exquisite detail we've come to associate with the Perfect Grade series -- over 550 ABS plastic parts, all molded in colour, plus polycaps for the joints, die-cast joint parts for stability, and of course the LED and wiring for the head (requires one CR1220 watch-type battery, sold separately). Parts are included for a Beam Rifle, shield, Armor-Schneider blades, and of course the positively enormous Grand Slam sword -- this last beautifully plated in silver!

    - The highly anticipated Perfect Grade Gundam Astray Red Frame has finally arrived! After a long hiatus without any brand-new entries in the Perfect Grade line since Perfect Grade Strike Gundam in 2004, Gundam modelers around the world now get to build a spectacular 1/60-scale kit of the popular mecha piloted by Lowe Guele in "Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Astray"!The kit is exquisitely detailed with great attention paid to reproducing its intricate mechanisms. Its snap-fit parts can be assembled without the use of glue, and also come molded in color so no painting is required to finish the model. Upon completion, the Mobile Suit will be fully articulated thanks to its super-flexible inner body frame that's capable of holding numerous realistic action poses, and its individual fingers are poseable, too! The "camera eyes" light up with internal wiring and a single LED (one CR1220 coin battery is required, not included). Die-cast metal joint parts are thoughtfully provided for stability. Its cockpit hatch can be opened to reveal a pilot seat for the included sitting-pose Lowe figure, and a same-scale standing-pose Lowe is also included. Marking stickers are provided to add custom detail to the completed model, and you also get rubber stickers for the Mobile Suit's soles for better grip of the surface so it won't slip while set in a dynamic pose.It can be equipped with its arsenal of weapons that consists of a Beam Rifle, shield, two Beam Sabers, and a Mobile Suit-sized Gerbera Straight katana with sheath. Its signature blade weapon comes molded in silver and gold plating that add to its realistic representation.

    - Beautifully-detailed EX model of the Archangel, from Gundam SEED, will require paint and glue to complete -- but is well worth the effort! These EX models offer better detail and accuracy than Bandai's usual snap-together kits, and allow you to paint precise colour schemes. Included are scale models of the Strike Gundam, Buster Gundam, Moebius Zero, and Sky Grasper (all unpainted). A display base is included as well.

    - Here's a recolor offering of the March 2009-released 1/100-scale Seravee Gundam, this time with all parts molded in the same light-toned color scheme as mecha designer Takayuki Yanase's concept illustration of Seravee Gundam and Seraphim Gundam, plus the addition of two LED units to light up Seravee's camera eyes and its backpack! This snap-fit plastic kit allows you to build a fully articulated 1/100-scale Seravee Gundam along with Seraphim Gundam, which can switch between its backpack mode and a poseable Mobile Suit. The torso-sized head on Seraphim Gundam can slide open into Face Burst Mode, and the mech's arms can also revert back into GN Cannons. Seravee Gundam's signature GN Bazooka II can be combined to form a massive Double Bazooka Cannon that can also slide open into Burst Cannon Mode. Attach each GN Bazooka II to the GN Cannons on its backpack to form the devastating Twin Buster Cannon! Switch on the LED units and it will light up the Gundam's camera eyes and backpack! Foil stickers, aurora stickers, and designer's marking stickers are included. Two coin batteries are required, not included.

    - Bandai's newest PG offering is truly deserving of the name "Perfect Grade," and it's also a two-in-one; you can build it as either the GP01 or the GP01Fb! Like previous Perfect Grade kits, this behemoth offers a level of detail and motion that's far beyond what you see in even the biggest Master Grade offerings. Panels and hatches all over the surface open, to reveal inner mechanical details. What's more, after you get done wading through over two dozen runners of literally thousands of parts, you'll have armament for the GP01 including two 60mm Vulcans, two beam sabers, and a beam rifle, as well as the Core Fighter II. For the GP01Fb, there are two extra beam guns, and you can build the Core Fighter II Fb. But that's not all -- the kit also includes the parts to build a hangar/dock (see photos below), with little figures of maintenance workers to position around it! A bonus card with a serial number on it also included. Act now, and add this beauty to your Perfect Grade collection (and don't forget to budget for the shipping costs, this item weighs 5kg/11 lbs.)!

In addition, landing gear are provided for both the Chest Flyer and Leg Flyer as a original gimmick that's never seen in the anime! The Sword Silhouette pack carried by the Silhouette Flyer can be attached to the back of the Mobile Suit to form Sword Impulse Gundam.Its weapons include a pair of Anti-Ship Laser Swords that can be combined into a double-bladed sword, a Beam Rifle, two Assault Knives, and an openable shield. The wing section of the Sword Silhouette pack is detachable for use as a giant boomerang, plus it can also be turned into a pair of Flash Edge beam boomerangs. Unpainted 1/100-scale figures of Shinn Asuka and Lunamaria Hawke (both molded in white) are packed in the set along with foil stickers, dry-transfer decals, and marking stickers to add detail to the completed model.

But all the Master Grade goodies you'd expect are here! Fully-posable at all joints; extensive internal detail; individually-posable finger joints; numerous weapons, including the laser sword, machine gun, two bazookas and Panzerfausts. Most of these mount right on the Dom's back or hips for firing and/or storage. Of course, the kit is also molded in color, and features snap assembly. Have fun!

This kit also comes with a figure of the pilot \"Mush\" (great name).Like all the kits in the MG series, the level of detail is superb, and virtually everything moves. The pipes running from the thighs to the calves, as well as around the sides of the head, are flexible springs covered with plastic tubes. The head has a panel that opens, and a small tab on the back of the head lets you position the Zaku's scanner eye.

Newly-designed joints allow it incredibly realistic posing -- especially in the legs. A tighter bend at the knee, and a joint that divides the heel and toe of the foot, provides better balance for \"\"action\"\" poses, and gives your Mk-II a realistic appearance when it's crouching, as though it's about to spring into action at any time! The kit is all molded in colour and snaps together; vinyl tubing is included for weapons detail. Also included are three scale figures (one pilot and two maintenance crew) for positioning around the Mk-II while it's \"docked\".

At first, when I saw that this kit came with a display stand to hold it up, I was greatly dissapointed, as I really was looking forward to building it. But then I started thinking about all the other Gundam kits of mine that have fallen over and broken or lost parts when I had them posed someplace, and I began to think that maybe a display stand isn't such a bad idea after all...Of course the kit can transform into the long-range \"G-Cruiser\" mode, similar to the Zeta Gundam, and the display stand itself also converts into a mode specifically designed for displaying the kit when it's in ship mode.

    - Zeta Gundam was broadcast on Japanese TV during '84/85, following up the original series with a whole new set of characters and machines. Not surprisingly, the robot of the same name was the main piece of hardware in the show. This new show also introduced the "transformation" concept to Gundam, and the Zeta does an impressive one, switching from robot mode to "Wave Rider" mode in the wink of an eye. Perhaps more impressive is the fact the this Master Grade kit can also make this transformation without a single piece having to be removed or replaced on it (not counting the shield/nose piece, but that's true to the show).This version of the 1/100 MG Zeta Gundam is the test version as it appeared at Anaheim Electronics during the initial phases of the project.Eight full-size runners with hundreds of multi-colored parts make this kit a serious assembly project, but it goes together very smoothly. Besides the transformation capability, the kit includes all kinds of other goodies. As usual, everything moves. Even those antenna on its forehead fold up. Three sets of hands are included -- fists, open palm, and posable. Also includes the usual "beam saber" sword, dual Vulcan cannon, beam rifle and shield. All of Bandai's MG (as well as HG) kits are completely snap-together, and parts are molded in color, so no painting is necessary. Of course, the use of cement and paints will improve the appearance of a finished model. Many of the surface markings are printed right onto the plastic parts to begin with, but the kit includes replacement transfers for those people who wish to paint their work.

    - Things don't get much better than this for Gundam fans.The kit that Bandai has produced is truly amazing. The most striking aspect is the incredible level of INNER detail. It's almost a shame to put any of the cover panels on this thing, because there is so much on the inside that a little silver and black paint will make very interesting to look at. Bandai is aware of this, and is also going to market an optional parts set for the kit that includes transparent body pieces! This is due in December, we're told. That set will also include a light-up beam saber.What can you say about this kit? Though some weapons are not included (no doubt for a later release), it's just about everything you could hope for in terms of detail and poseability. Even little actuators in some joints slide in and out like hydraulic pistons when you move them (wrists, etc.). What's more, a watch battery (CR1220) lights the eyes in the head, activated by a tiny switch on the back. Other gimmicks include wings on the core fighter which fold automatically when you tuck in the nose for docking. For a true Gundam hobbyist, there's simply no question about whether you should order this. Even if you don't plan on painting or gluing anything, you should prepare yourself for several evenings of snipping, trimming and snapping before your masterpiece will be completed. There are, after all, 626 parts on 23 runners which combine to form a model that stands nearly 31cm high and 13cm wide with 66 moving joints and 29 opening hatches. What fun!

    - Extremely crisp detail and precision moldings feature highly in the EX Model series, devoted to high-quality kits. The slightly higher price is always worth it for such a well-executed product. And to what better kit to apply such technology, than the Mobile Ship Albion, from the Gundam 0083 series? Stunning detail in the injection plastic and white metal parts means you get a supremely accurate model in 1/1700 scale! These EX Model kits are intended to be painted and displayed; and the Albion comes with a display stand for just that purpose. Also included are tiny 1 cm figures of the GP-01 and GP-02A, in scale to match the Albion.

    - The most impressive model in Bandai's history is finally here! This kit has too much to list in detail, so please be willing to settle for the highlights:30-plus runners of parts (670 total pieces). About 30 locations secured by metal screws. Two different locations (eyes and chest) light up on the finished kit. Full inner mechanism detail on all limbs. Opening panels on the head, chest, and more. Fingers are individually jointed. Comes with two beam sabers and two huge beam rifles. Locking systems provide stability so things don't flap around like they tend to do on the Master Grade kit. Comes boxed in three separate inner boxes plus a special box that contains the 14 individual "feathers" made from plastic-coated thin metal, plus the metal joint parts, screws, and other goodies. Two separate manuals are included. The first, the INSTRUCTION manual (text is in Japanese), has numerous photos of the kit in various construction steps plus painting guide, history of the unit and the Battle Zero unit, cross sections, and an interview with the designer of the kit. The second, the CONSTRUCTION manual, has the actual assembly instructions and details. No English text but the diagrams are self-explanatory.This is a very complex model kit and, as our "Skill Level 4" rating indicates, is not recommended for beginner modelers.

    - Beautiful EX model of the Moebius Zero and Sky Grasper machines from Gundam Seed. The EX models are more highly detailed than the usual Gundam models, and with slightly more complex construction; but they are still molded in colored plastic and the pieces still just snap together. However, paint would definitely improve the overall look of the finished products. Launcher Strike Gundam and Sword Strike Gundam weapons not included. Join the Sky Grasper with the Aile Striker (also not included) as well!

    - With a massive height of 50cm and a wingspan of 60cm, you get a lot of bang for your yen with this new version of the Strike Freedom!At its base, this is a regular snap-together plastic Gundam kit; all the parts are molded in colour, and you will need no paint or glue for assembly. Foil stickers and clear Gundam stickers are included for detail.The only thing that makes this kit different from any other 1/60 scale kit is the lighting throughout! Dozens of translucent yellow and blue parts are included, as well as lighting contacts, light bulbs, and a diode. The lighting starts at the included display base, and the wiring is integral to the building of the kit itself; simple pictorial instructions will get you through the construction with a little patience (and perhaps the experience of having built a fairly complex Gundam kit before).1 CR1220 and 3 AA batteries are required, but not included. A teeny scale (non-painted) model of Kira Yamato is included; and all of the Strike Freedom Gundam's weaponry is included -- the Dragoon, rail guns, beam sabres, beam rifles, and a beam shield (though unfortunately these don't light up).

Specializing in melee combat, Gundam Exia is a formidable opponent in battle that can effortlessly slice and dice through armies of Mobile Suits with his Seven Sword System. The popular machine comes sharply molded in color and incredibly flexible upon completion. It can hold various dynamic action poses as well as signature stances seen in the show, and detail is spot on with intricate mechanisms realized on its highly-articulated inner frame as we've come to expect from an MG release. Clear green lenses are provided for its chest, and sides of its head, elbows, and knees, while all cord sections on the body utilizes hologram parts and clear parts so you can view its mechanisms underneath. Its complete Seven Sword System is provided consisting of a GN Long Blade, a GN Short Blade, two GN Beam Daggers, two GN Beam Sabers, a GN Sword that can switch between rifle mode and gun mode, plus a GN Shield with sides that can slide out. A dedicated clear base is also included for displaying the detachable GN Drive, and a red cover part can be attached to the back of Gundam Exia in place of the GN Drive. Two same-scale figures (molded in white) of Setsuna in standing and sitting poses are packed in the set along with foil stickers, dry transfer stickers, and MG Gundam Exia original marking stickers for detail.

Two sets of hands (open palm and weapon-gripping) are included. Shoulder cannons can be replaced with rocket launchers as well. Rifle also included. Stands a bit over 12cm tall when completed.
