Both the front and side skirt armor parts are linked together so that the side skirt armor will slide back when the front skirt armor is moved upwards so as to not restrict the Mobile Suit's movements. In pursuit of easing the assembly process for modelers, Bandai came up with an ingenious method of molding each individual section of the pipe cover in straight rows on the plastic runner so you can easily insert the power pipe through each row of pipe covers and snap each of them off without having to individually cut and slide each piece to the power pipe! That'll shave off at least a few minutes of assembly time! Its signature weaponry includes a shield, a Heat Saber, a Heat Rod, and a Finger Vulcan for its left hand. A regular manipulator left hand is also included to replace the Finger Vulcan if you so desire. Each section of the Heat Rod is ball-jointed so you can bend it into any shape you want!
