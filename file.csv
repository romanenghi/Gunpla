BAN958756,MG GOUF Ver.2.0,"A Mobile Suit made famous at the hands of ace pilot Lieutenant Ramba Ral, the MS-07B Gouf is a high-performance machine that strikes fear in its opponents with its powerful Heat Saber and Heat Rod at its disposal. This much-anticipated ""Version 2.0"" update to its 2000-released Master Grade kit not only utilizes the same amazingly detailed and super-poseable inner frame from MG MS-06J Zaku II Ver. 2.0, Bandai went a step further in enhancing the inner frame to allow for wider range of posing possibilities and smoother movements! Both the front and side skirt armor parts are linked together so that the side skirt armor will slide back when the front skirt armor is moved upwards so as to not restrict the Mobile Suit's movements. In pursuit of easing the assembly process for modelers, Bandai came up with an ingenious method of molding each individual section of the pipe cover in straight rows on the plastic runner so you can easily insert the power pipe through each row of pipe covers and snap each of them off without having to individually cut and slide each piece to the power pipe! That'll shave off at least a few minutes of assembly time! Its signature weaponry includes a shield, a Heat Saber, a Heat Rod, and a Finger Vulcan for its left hand. A regular manipulator left hand is also included to replace the Finger Vulcan if you so desire. Each section of the Heat Rod is ball-jointed so you can bend it into any shape you want! The blade part of the Heat Saber is made of clear orange, and the Mobile Suit's cockpit can slide open to reveal a sitting-pose pilot figure (molded in light blue). Also packed in the set are in-scale figures (molded in light blue) of Ramba Ral and his aide Crowley Hamon. A sheet of stickers and dry-transfer markings are included.
