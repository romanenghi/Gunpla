This much-anticipated 'Version 2.0' update to its 2000-released Master Grade kit not only utilizes the same amazingly detailed and super-poseable inner frame from MG MS-06J Zaku II Ver. 2.0, Bandai went a step further in enhancing the inner frame to allow for wider range of posing possibilities and smoother movements! Both the front and side skirt armor parts are linked together so that the side skirt armor will slide back when the front skirt armor is moved upwards so as to not restrict the Mobile Suit''s movements. In pursuit of easing the assembly process for modelers, Bandai came up with an ingenious method of molding each individual section of the pipe cover in straight rows on the plastic runner so you can easily insert the power pipe through each row of pipe covers and snap each of them off without having to individually cut and slide each piece to the power pipe! That''ll shave off at least a few minutes of assembly time! Its signature weaponry includes a shield, a Heat Saber, a Heat Rod, and a Finger Vulcan for its left hand. A regular manipulator left hand is also included to replace the Finger Vulcan if you so desire. Each section of the Heat Rod is ball-jointed so you can bend it into any shape you want! The blade part of the Heat Saber is made of clear orange, and the Mobile Suit''s cockpit can slide open to reveal a sitting-pose pilot figure (molded in light blue). Also packed in the set are in-scale figures (molded in light blue) of Ramba Ral and his aide Crowley Hamon.

Not only that, it doubles as a very cool-looking inner mechanism for when you want to display your kit with the panels open or removed.

Newly-designed joints allow it incredibly realistic posing -- especially in the legs. A tighter bend at the knee, and a joint that divides the heel and toe of the foot, provides better balance for ''action'' poses, and gives your Mk-II a realistic appearance when it''s crouching, as though it''s about to spring into action at any time! The kit is all molded in colour and snaps together; vinyl tubing is included for weapons detail. Also included is a catapult display stand -- and three scale figures (one pilot and two maintenance crew) for positioning around the Mk-II while it''s 'docked.' Not just an improvement on the original kit, the Version 2.0 takes the Mk-II to a whole new level!

That set will also include a light-up beam saber.What can you say about this kit? Though some weapons are not included (no doubt for a later release), it''s just about everything you could hope for in terms of detail and poseability. Even little actuators in some joints slide in and out like hydraulic pistons when you move them (wrists, etc.). What''s more, a watch battery (CR1220) lights the eyes in the head, activated by a tiny switch on the back. Other gimmicks include wings on the core fighter which fold automatically when you tuck in the nose for docking. For a true Gundam hobbyist, there''s simply no question about whether you should order this. Even if you don''t plan on painting or gluing anything, you should prepare yourself for several evenings of snipping, trimming and snapping before your masterpiece will be completed.

The Master Grade series that was born from that idea has, without exaggeration, literally fueled much of the growth of HobbyLink Japan itself!And now, stolen right from the world of computer software, comes another idea that may also prove to be a very good one: Upgrades! 'Version 1.5' of the RX-78-2 Gundam kit is, with the exception of the arms, an entirely new kit. The proportions of the item have changed to bring it more in line with the Perfect Grade kit of the same mecha. But perhaps most importantly, Bandai has attempted to address one of the biggest troubles that plague posable robot kits -- joints that are too soft -- by creating a one-piece, almost pre-assembled inner leg mechanism that is very firm -- ready to stay put in whatever pose you want it to. Not only that, it doubles as a very cool-looking inner mechanism for when you want to display your kit with the panels open or removed. As usual, you also get a bunch of fun weapons, including the beam rifle, bazooka, a Gundam Hammer with a plastic chain, a new beam javelin, and of course, beam sabers.

Sharply molded in color, the transformable Impulse Gundam is formed by three main parts: Chest Flyer, Core Splendor, and Leg Flyer. Core Splendor''s cockpit can be opened to insert an in-scale sitting pilot figure. In addition, landing gear are provided for both the Chest Flyer and Leg Flyer as a original gimmick that''s never seen in the anime! The Sword Silhouette pack carried by the Silhouette Flyer can be attached to the back of the Mobile Suit to form Sword Impulse Gundam.Its weapons include a pair of Anti-Ship Laser Swords that can be combined into a double-bladed sword, a Beam Rifle, two Assault Knives, and an openable shield. The wing section of the Sword Silhouette pack is detachable for use as a giant boomerang, plus it can also be turned into a pair of Flash Edge beam boomerangs. Unpainted 1/100-scale figures of Shinn Asuka and Lunamaria Hawke (both molded in white) are packed in the set along with foil stickers, dry-transfer decals, and marking stickers to add detail to the completed model.

When using the U-shaped or screw-on holders, double-sided tape (small quantity included) should be applied in between the crotch of the kit and the holders to hold it in place. A name plate is included that can be attached to any one of the holes on the base. (The package notes that there may be cases of a kit not able to fit.)Each Action Base 1 can be attached to up to six other Action Base 1s for you to create an amazing display filled with Gundam kits or other robot kits striking cool action poses!
